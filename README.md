## Description
SimLKAS provides a modular simulation framework to evaluate LKAS performance under various conditions, including adverse weather and complex road geometries. It integrates perception, control, and evaluation components for systematic testing.

## LaneNet Model Notice
This repository includes the **LaneNet model** code, copied from  
[MaybeShewill-CV/lanenet-lane-detection](https://github.com/MaybeShewill-CV/lanenet-lane-detection).  

- LaneNet is **only used for testing purposes** in our experiments.  
- It is **not the backbone of our lane detection algorithm** within SimLKAS.  
- Full credit for LaneNet goes to the original authors. Please see their repository for details and licensing.
